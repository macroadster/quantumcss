# Critical Issues Report: QuantumCSS Framework

**Date:** February 1, 2026
**Subject:** Major deficiencies in basic utility generation and component styling

To the maintainers of QuantumCSS,

I am writing to report several critical issues encountered while attempting to implement a simple blog template using the "Starlight" design system. Despite following the documentation and using the provided CLI tools, the out-of-the-box experience is "nasty and poorly implemented."

Here are the specific defects that make the framework currently unusable without extensive manual patching:

## 1. Non-Existent Link Styling
**Issue:** Anchor tags (`<a href="...">`) have absolutely no default styling or clear utility classes to handle them effectively in the context of the Starlight theme.
**Impact:** Links blend in indistinguishably with text or look raw and broken, ruining the user experience.
**Expected Behavior:** A framework promoting a specific aesthetic ("Starlight") should provide distinct, theme-aware states for links (hover, active, visited) that match the neon/glassmorphism vibe.

## 2. Broken Badge Components
**Issue:** The `.badge` and associated classes (e.g., `.badge-primary`, `.badge-secondary`) fail to render correctly.
**Observation:** They appear as unstyled spans or lack the necessary padding, border-radius, and background opacity adjustments that define a "badge."
**Impact:** Metadata elements like "Tags" or "Categories" look broken and unprofessional.

## 3. Vertical Spacing Failure
**Issue:** The vertical spacing utilities (specifically `space-y-*` patterns) are either missing from the generator's output or fail to apply the correct margin-top rules to child elements.
**Impact:** Content is mashed together with no breathing room. I had to manually write CSS to prevent all elements from collapsing into a dense vertical pile.

## 4. Generator / JIT Inconsistency
**Issue:** Standard responsive grid utilities (e.g., `lg:grid-cols-12`) were not generated by the CLI, despite being standard patterns in modern utility frameworks.
**Workaround:** I was forced to manually write a `manual-fixes.css` file to re-implement basic grid logic that the tool claimed to handle.

## 5. Broken Layering and Z-Index
**Issue:** The generator fails to output basic z-index utility classes (e.g., `.z-50`). 
**Observation:** Even worse, internal library components like `.starlight-card` have hardcoded `z-index: 1`, while the sticky navigation menu (intended to be the top layer) remains at the base level because the `.z-50` utility was never generated.
**Impact:** Critical UI elements like headers and menus are swallowed by body content during scroll, creating a broken and amateurish visual experience.

## Conclusion
The promise of a "Next-Generation Utility Framework" is completely undermined when basic layout (grids, spacing), layering (z-index), and core UI elements (links, badges) require manual CSS fixes to look even remotely presentable. The current state feels like a pre-alpha release rather than a production-ready tool.

I strongly recommend an immediate audit of the `component-utilities` plugin, the z-index utility mappings, and the responsive generation logic.
